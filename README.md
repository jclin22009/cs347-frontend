# Dash Adapt Frontend

Hello! Welcome to the frontend of Dash Adapt. To get started with our project, follow the below instructions. Don't hesitate to email me (jasoncl) if you have any questions!

## Quickstart

In the project directory, you can run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies. Then, `npm run build` and `npm start`.

This will start the app on `localhost:3001`. Please make sure it is running at this valid port!

## Breakdown

This is a React app responsible for parsing interaction with the `server.py` backend over a socket and rendering recommendations in a rich format. The brunt of the code is in `ChatBox.jsx`, which contains key functions for communicating with the backend.

## Future Directions

As we continue to build out Dash Adapt, we will add integration with existing webpages (like Doordash) to add ways for the user to interact with the bot. We will explore other avenues mixed AI-human interfaces, such as highlighting boxes on the Doordash page relevant to the user's ordering step.
